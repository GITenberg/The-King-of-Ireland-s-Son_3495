description: "The King of Ireland's Son is a children's novel published in Ireland\
  \ in 1916 written by Padraic Colum, and illustrated by Willy Pogany. It is the story\
  \ of the eldest of the King of Ireland's sons, and his adventures winning and then\
  \ finding Fedelma, the Enchanter's Daughter, who after being won is kidnapped from\
  \ him by the King of the Land of Mist. It is solidly based in Irish folklore, itself\
  \ being originally a folktale.\nThis is one of the classics of Irish children's\
  \ literature, its magical stories winding in and out of each other from the start,\
  \ when the careless son goes out,\nHis hound at his heel,His hawk on his wrist,A\
  \ brave steed to carry him whither he list,The blue sky above him,The green grass\
  \ below him\nand meets an eccentric old man full of harmlessness and duplicity who\
  \ invites him to a game of chess for whatever stake the winner might like. Characters\
  \ like Flann, otherwise known as Gilly the Goat-Boy, the proud and heartless Lasarfhiona\
  \ or Flame-of-Wine, the magical Spae-Woman and the vicious farmer who takes on Flann\
  \ as a farmhand make this an entrancing, funny and always-remembered story.\nWritten\
  \ in the years before 1916 in America by Colum, a close friend and colleague of\
  \ some of those who led the Easter Rising, this was the ultimate calling-up of Irish\
  \ mythology and legend, and, paired with James Stephens' Irish Fairy Tales, made\
  \ many happy hours for children curled up before glowing turf fires to read by the\
  \ light of Tilley lamps in the long winter evenings of the new Ireland.\nAnother\
  \ evolution from the original folktale was written by Brendan Behan, published in\
  \ Brendan Behan's Island, 1962, pp. 136â€“141.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
